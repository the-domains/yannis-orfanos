Hi! Here you can find a brief overview of my research work.
As a data urbanist and researcher, I seek solutions that improve the quality of life in cities and address climate change risks. 
Always passionate about the intersection of physical and digital worlds, I have been developing tools that synthesize computational, spatial and strategic frameworks.
The tools, products of applied research both in academia and the industry, focus on efficient infrastructure systems, sustainable urban development, and enabling communities.
