Based on research findings from a data-driven approach on urban water management for the Zofnass Program, I supervised the development of a web tool for non-expert awareness on better managing water systems. It is an open interactive educational platform that enables community stakeholders with information.The tool has two main components: current situation (analysis) and what if (modelling). The analysis component provides an overview of the current water system, its performance, and the related geospatial information. The "what if" component identifies green infrastructure opportunities and quantifies their potential impact on city's impervious cover, stormwater management, and the overall water system performance. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dcec4a85-dd6c-4817-ae10-b6c844aa5d60.png)
